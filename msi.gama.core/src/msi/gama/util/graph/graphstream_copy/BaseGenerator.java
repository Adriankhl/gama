/**
 * Base graph generator.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is a base to implement generators. It it has facilities to generate edges or nodes, and provides services
 * to add attributes on them and to choose if the edge is directed or not.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Indeed, This generator has the ability to add randomly chosen numerical values on arbitrary attributes on edges or
 * nodes of the graph, and to randomly choose a direction for edges.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A list of attributes can be given for nodes and edges. In this case each new node or edge added will have this
 * attribute and the value will be a randomly chosen number. The range in which these numbers are chosen can be
 * specified.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * By default, edges are not oriented. It is possible to ask orientation, and in addition to ask that the direction be
 * chosen randomly (by default, if edges must be oriented, the order given for the two nodes to connect is used).
 * </p>
