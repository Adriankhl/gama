It is possible to use in the models a set of built-in agents. These agents allow to directly use some advance features like clustering, multi-criteria analysis, etc. The creation of these agents are similar as for other kinds of agents:

{{{
create species: my_built_in_agent returns: the_agent;
}}}
    
So, for instance, to be able to use clustering techniques in the model:
{{{
create cluster_builder returns: clusterer;
}}}

The list of available built-in agents in GAMA is:

  * cluster_builder: allows to use clustering techniques on a set of agents.
  * multicriteria_analyzer: allows to use multi-criteria analysis methods.
